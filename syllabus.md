### COURSE DESCRIPTION

The past decade has witnessed an explosion of data produced by websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia, the mass digitization of administrative and historical records, and the rapid expansion of mobile technology into nearly every corner of our lives. A new wave of techniques for collecting, classifying, and analyzing these data hold enormous potential to address many of the most urgent questions in social science: How do diseases spread? What causes financial meltdowns? How did America become so politically polarized? This course surveys the nascent inter-disciplinary field of data science (and it’s cousin, computational social science), which combines insights from computer and information science, sociology and social network analysis, economics, political science, and public health in order to answer such questions.

### COURSE GOALS

This course requires no prior knowledge of computer programming or social science. Students will obtain basic skills that will enable them to automate collection of data about cultural globalization from social media sites, classify these highly unstructured data into discrete variables that can be analyzed using conventional social science models, and analyze them using a combination of techniques that includes screen-scraping, natural language processing and machine learning. We will also discuss the complex ethical and legal issues that arise when working with these novel sources of data. In order to obtain these skills, we will perform a group research project together.

***Required Readings***
<br/>
- **Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age**, Matthew J Salganik, 2017, *Princeton University Press*: [https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/)
<br/><br/>

***Annotated Computer Code***
<br/>
At the end of each class on Thursday, I will upload the code we write together to the Github site linked above in order to help you practice your coding skills and, eventually, contribute to the code that we will write together as part of our group project.
<br/><br/>

***Stack Overflow***
<br/>
The field of computational social science is going so rapidly that none of the resources I give you will remain at the cutting edge for long. You will almost certainly encounter issues unique to the data we collect as part of our group research project and/or incompatibilities between software packages and/or your computer. Stack Overflow is a website where computer programmers help each other solve such problems. Individuals ask questions, and others earn “reputation points” for solving their problems—these reputation points are awarded by the person who asks the question as well as other site users who vote upon the elegance/efficiency of each solution. For you, this reputation system means you can quickly identify the most high-quality solutions to your problems.
<br/><br/>

***R & RStudio***
<br/>
In this class, we will use the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) software, which is free and open-source. There are a variety of different ways to use R, but the most common way to do so is with the software [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a free Graphical User Interface which you can either run on your laptop, or via a web server. R and RStudio are both supported by a vibrant community of individuals who have created a treasure-trove of learning resources online. Here is a link to some very helpful beginner tutorials, and this link also includes some intermediate and advanced tutorials if you really want to challenge yourself.
<br/><br/>

***Slack***
<br/>

<br/><br/>


***Twitter/Blogs***
<br/>
Many of the most important advances in computational social science appear first on Twitter or blogs. I therefore encourage you to open a Twitter account-if you don’t already have one- and follow the authors we read, or consider checking out the people I follow. Having a Twitter account will also come in handy for some of the exercises we do in class to collect data from Twitter. Of the many blogs that you might read, I recommend R Bloggers, which provides a concise overview of new functions in R as well as solutions to common problems faced by computational social scientists, as well as those in other fields.

### FORMAL REQUIREMENTS

This class alternates between discussions of assigned readings and “labs” where you will learn how to code computational social science as we do an original research project together. We will identify the topic of our research project during the first few weeks of the class. You must complete the assigned reading BEFORE each discussion class. However, you will complete lab assignments AFTER each lab class, which are designed to help you practice your skills. Note that lab assignments are ungraded, but mandatory. Please also note that there is no separate lab meeting outside the regular class hours. Instead every other one of these meetings constitutes a lab.
<br/>

***Reading***
<br/>
You are responsible for understanding the readings. Make use of your fellow students, the Internet, a dictionary, and me to ensure that you understand the readings. Discussion sections will be used for substantive discussion and further exploration of the implications of the course readings, not for grasping basic concepts. Remember that this syllabus is a “living document.” By this I mean I reserve the right to change the reading assignments in response to your feedback as well as my own sense of our group achievement. No changes will be made without at least one week’s notice.
<br/><br/>
	
***Participation***
<br/>
Attendance is mandatory at every class, though all students are allowed one excused absence over the course of the semester. Your participation grade will be calculated on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 in order to reflect the quality of your contribution to classroom and Slack discussions. As the table below shows, participation will count for 25% of your grade. Once again, classroom discussions are not intended to clarify key concepts, instead, we will be discussing the pros and cons of each authors’ arguments, or extensions thereof. Most importantly, we will discuss whether or how the readings should shape our group research project (described below). On Slack, you will organize your group and further develop the research project, which is why your participation there is also counted toward your grade. In other words, your participation grade assesses the extent to which you have thoughtfully engaged with the reading material and contributed to your group’s research project. For some of you, the idea of being graded for participation will be new—if you ever have questions about how to achieve a good participation grade (or if you want to know your current participation grade), please contact me via email at the address above.
<br/><br/>

***Group Project***
<br/>
Numerous studies arrive at the same conclusion: students learn more when they are actively engaged in activities in class (even if they sometimes think they learn less through such activities). The challenge, then, is for us all to think about ways to get you engaged in the classroom. My own view is that we cannot simply ask you to think through hypothetical situations or puzzles: we should all learn together by doing actual research together that could change the world. This may sound like a lofty goal, but my bet is that we will learn much more while failing to achieve an ambitious goal than if we do not try. And if we get lucky, maybe our research will be good enough to share with the world (either in a blog post or perhaps even a full-blown piece of scholarly research in an academic journal). At the end of each week of class, I will assign teams of students to work on different parts of the group research project.

You will receive two grades for your group project: the first (which counts for 50% of your course grade), comes from me, and the second (which counts for 25% of your grade) comes from your classmates. Here are the guidelines for grading, which are designed in line with widespread grade inflation at most U.S. universities:

> A+ Student contributes to group research project in a truly exceptional manner. This includes dedicating a very large amount of hours outside of class (>6 hrs/week) to help us design and execute our research, collect and analyze data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript. This student goes beyond doing what they are told by others and independently identifies work that needs to be done to the benefit of everyone in the group. The student also helps others learn and helps the instructor think about ways to improve the class for future cohorts.

> A+ Student contributes to group research project at an extremely high level. This includes dedicating a large amount of hours (~ 12 hrs/week) outside of class time to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> A Student contributes to group research project at a very high level. This includes dedicating a large amount of hours (~ 6 hrs/week) outside of class time to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript. 

> A- Student contributes to group research project at a high level. This includes dedicating many hours outside of class time (~4-6 hrs/week) to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B+ Student makes a substantial contribution to the group project. This includes dedicating substantial hours outside of class time (~4 hrs/week) toward data collection and analysis and writing up our results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B Student makes a contribution to the group project. This includes dedicating some hours outside of class time (~2-4 hrs/week) toward data collection or analysis and writing up our results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B- Student makes a minor contribution to the group project and contributes only a small amount of time outside of class (~2 hrs/week) to collect data, analyze data, or write up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> C or below Student does not make an impactful contribution to the group project. Grades below C should be reserved for students who willfully ignored the group, or impeded its progress by acting in an uncivil or unserious manner.
