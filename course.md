### COURSE DESCRIPTION

The past decade has witnessed an explosion of data produced by websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia, the mass digitization of administrative and historical records, and the rapid expansion of mobile technology into nearly every corner of our lives. A new wave of techniques for collecting, classifying, and analyzing these data hold enormous potential to address many of the most urgent questions in social science: How do diseases spread? What causes financial meltdowns? How did America become so politically polarized? This course surveys the nascent inter-disciplinary field of computational social science, which combines insights from computer and information science, sociology and social network analysis, economics, political science, and public health in order to answer such questions.

### COURSE GOALS

This course requires no prior knowledge of computer programming or social science. Students will learn to ask social science questions, and learn how to answer them by collecting data from digital sources such as social media sites. Students will also aquire skills in social network analysis, automated text analysis, application programming interfaces, and the R programming language.


### OVERVIEW OF CLASS FORMAT

**Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this class will unfortunately be held entirely online**. The format of the class and course requirements are designed to provide maximum flexibility to you as we all navigate these unprecedented times-- but also to build in new opportunities to learn through deeper engagement with me.

Each week, there will be two re-recorded lectures that average 15-20 minutes each. One of these lectures will be about a social science topic (e.g. political polarization or public health), and the other is designed to introduce you to the lab assignment for that week. There are also required readings for each week that build upon the content in the lectures, and help introduce you to the material you need to learn for the labs. The lab assignments do not line up with the content of the social science lectures; instead, the goal is to introduce both social science and coding gradually/incrementally. 

In addition to viewing the lectures each week, you will be required to sign up for a weekly 15 minute one-on-one meeting with me via Zoom to discuss a topic of your choice from either the readings or the lab. My decision to meet with you individually instead of in groups is guided by my extensive previous experience teaching on Zoom, which has taught me that it is a very ineffective format for conventional conversations in Duke courses. Meeting one on one will also help me tailor the class to your needs, and help you achieve all of the work for our class-- weekly labs, and a final project that you will present during the last week of the semester. I am also hoping that weekly one-on-one time with me will off set some of the disappointment that we all feel about not being on campus and learning together in a normal setting.


***Required Readings***
<br/>
We will draw heavily on two excellent books, both of which are freely available online thanks to the generosity of the authors. If you can afford to purchase a hard copy to show your appreciation for their hard work, please consider it.

- [**Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age**](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/). Matthew J Salganik (2017), *Princeton University Press*
- [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham, *O'Reilly*: )
<br/>

***R & RStudio***
<br/>
In this class, we will use the R, a free programming language that I will teach tou how to install during the first week of class. There are a variety of different ways to use R, but the most common way to do so is with the software [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a free Graphical User Interface which you can either run on your laptop, or via a web server. Though it is possible to run it on a Tablet or Microsoft Surface, I recommend using a laptop or desktop if possible.
<br/>

***Slack***
<br/>
We will be using [Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYqxQGmQkVw ) to communicate with each other. Slack is a messaging platform that let's us share code, web links, and other things easily- it also allows me to make announcements to the class and share other things I think you might find interesting (e.g. internship announcements or articles that build upon our discussions with each other). Slack is also used by many different companies and organizations in and outside the tech world, so this might be a great chance to learn how to use it if you have not already.

Please download Slack to your desktop and/or phone and tablet and join [this workplace](https://join.slack.com/t/dssfall2020workspace/shared_invite/zt-go2w5loi-H1I~Ed4pDx6ieCJwXiSEcQ). You can learn more about how to get started with Slack [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members). Part of your participation grade-described in additional detail below- will rely on your Slack participation. 
<br/>

***Stack Overflow***
<br/>
The field of computational social science is going so rapidly that none of the resources I give you will remain at the cutting edge for long. You will almost certainly encounter issues unique to the data we collect as part of our group research project and/or incompatibilities between software packages and/or your computer. Stack Overflow is a website where computer programmers help each other solve such problems. Individuals ask questions, and others earn “reputation points” for solving their problems—these reputation points are awarded by the person who asks the question as well as other site users who vote upon the elegance/efficiency of each solution. For you, this reputation system means you can quickly identify the most high-quality solutions to your problems. Take a tour of the site [here](https://stackoverflow.com/tour).
<br/>

***Twitter/Blogs***
<br/>
Many of the most important advances in computational social science appear first on Twitter or blogs. I therefore encourage you to open a Twitter account-if you don’t already have one- and follow the authors we read, or consider checking out the people [I follow](https://twitter.com/chris_bail/following). Having a Twitter account will also come in handy for some of the exercises we do in class to collect data from Twitter. Of the many blogs that you might read, I recommend R Bloggers, which provides a concise overview of new functions in R as well as solutions to common problems faced by computational social scientists, as well as those in other fields.
<br/>


### FORMAL REQUIREMENTS

This class alternates between discussions of assigned readings and “labs” where you will learn how to code computational social science and an original group research project that you will create in small teams. You must complete the assigned reading BEFORE each discussion class. However, you will complete lab assignments AFTER each lab class, which are designed to help you practice your skills. Please also note that there is no separate lab meeting outside the regular class hours. Instead every other one of these meetings constitutes a lab.
<br/>

***Weekly Readings***
<br/>
You are responsible for understanding the readings. Make use of your fellow students, your TA, the Internet, a dictionary, and me to ensure that you understand the readings. Discussion classes will be used for substantive discussion and further exploration of the implications of the course readings, not for grasping basic concepts. Remember that this syllabus is a 'living document.' By this I mean I reserve the right to change the reading assignments in response to your feedback as well as my own sense of our group achievement. No changes will be made without at least two weeks of advance notice.
<br/>

***Weekly Lab Assignments***
<br/>
By **midnight on Sunday of each week**, you will be required to complete and submit the assigned lab exercises described on the course schedule on this website. You must submit your lab assignments in a format called "R markdown" (abbreviated .Rmd). A video that describes how to create files in this format is available on the Schedule for the second lab (the first lab assignment is ungraded).

Labs will comprise 25% of your final grade. Students are permitted to miss one lab assignment without penalty. The remaining 8 assignments will be worth 3% each (you get one 1% free). Assignments will be graded according to your attempt to complete them: 1% for attempting the majority of exercises, 2% for attempting all exercises, 3% for attempting *and* annotating all exercises.

Submit all homework assignments to our TA (Devin Cornell) via direct message on Slack.
<br/>

***Weekly Meeting with Dr. Bail***
<br/>
Each week, you will be required to meet with me for 15 minutes to discuss the readings or the lab assignments (your choice). As I mentioned above, the purpose of these meetings is so that I can tailor the class to you and give you the best online course experience possible. These meetings do not count towards your grade, however, I think they will be very useful in helping you to design and conduct the final project for our class, which counts for 50% of your grade. You can use our time together to ask questions about the assigned readings, or discuss possible topics for your final project, which should build upon one or more of the required readings on our schedule. **You may cancel any of the one-on-one meetings with me at your discretion-- especially if unforeseen circumstances arise because of the pandemic- however, I ask that you give me 24 hours notice if you plan to cancel our meeting**

***Participation***
<br/>
Your participation grade will be calculated on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 in order to reflect the quality of your contribution to classroom and Slack discussions. If you find it difficult to make thoughtful comments about the readings during class, for example, you can contribute to discussions after class on Slack. As the table below shows, participation will count for 25% of your grade. Once again, classroom discussions are not intended to clarify key concepts, instead, we will be discussing the pros and cons of each authors’ arguments, or extensions thereof. Most importantly, we will discuss whether or how the readings should shape your group research projects (described below). On Slack, you will organize your group and further develop the research project, which is another reason why your participation there is also counted toward your grade. In other words, your participation grade assesses the extent to which you have thoughtfully engaged with the reading material and contributed to your group’s research project. For some of you, the idea of being graded for participation will be new—if you ever have questions about how to achieve a good participation grade (or if you want to know your current participation grade), please contact me via email at the address above.
<br/>

***Group Project***
<br/>
Numerous studies arrive at the same conclusion: students learn more when they are actively engaged in activities in class (even if they sometimes think they learn less through such activities). The challenge, then, is for us all to think about ways to get you engaged in the classroom. My own view is that we cannot simply ask you to think through hypothetical situations or puzzles: we should all learn together by doing actual research together that could change the world. This may sound like a lofty goal, but my bet is that we will learn much more while failing to achieve an ambitious goal than if we do not try. And if we get lucky, maybe your research will be good enough to share with the world (either in a blog post or perhaps even a full-blown piece of scholarly research in an academic journal). At the end of each week of class, I will assign teams of students to work on different parts of the group research project.

You will receive two grades for your group project: the first (which counts for 25% of your course grade), comes from me, and the second (which counts for 25% of your grade) comes from your classmates. Here are the guidelines for grading, which are designed in line with widespread grade inflation at most U.S. universities:

> A+ Student contributes to group research project in a truly exceptional manner. This includes dedicating a very large amount of hours outside of class (>6 hrs/week) to help us design and execute our research, collect and analyze data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript. This student goes beyond doing what they are told by others and independently identifies work that needs to be done to the benefit of everyone in the group. The student also helps others learn and helps the instructor think about ways to improve the class for future cohorts.

> A+ Student contributes to group research project at an extremely high level. This includes dedicating a large amount of hours (~ 12 hrs/week) outside of class time to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> A Student contributes to group research project at a very high level. This includes dedicating a large amount of hours (~ 6 hrs/week) outside of class time to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript. 

> A- Student contributes to group research project at a high level. This includes dedicating many hours outside of class time (~ 4-6 hrs/week) to help to design and execute the research, collect and analyzing data, and write-up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B+ Student makes a substantial contribution to the group project. This includes dedicating substantial hours outside of class time (~ 4 hrs/week) toward data collection and analysis and writing up our results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B Student makes a contribution to the group project. This includes dedicating some hours outside of class time (~ 2-4 hrs/week) toward data collection or analysis and writing up our results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> B- Student makes a minor contribution to the group project and contributes only a small amount of time outside of class (~ 2 hrs/week) to collect data, analyze data, or write up the results in our final co-authored blog post or manuscript.

> C or below Student does not make an impactful contribution to the group project. Grades below C should be reserved for students who willfully ignored the group, or impeded its progress by acting in an uncivil or unserious manner.
